# 2017-Spring-Digital-Visual-Effect
Assignments and Project of the course Digital Visual Effect, Spring 2017

## Project 1: High Dynamic Range Imaging

High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have large dynamic ranges which correspond to irradiance value of a scene in physical world. This project implemented a program to assemble an HDR image from a list of images with identical scene but with different exposure times.

## Project 2: Image Stitching

Image stitching is useful when creating an image with larger field of view (FOV) by stitching a set of images altogether. A common application of image stitching is to create a panorama, which has a wide-horizontal-angle view. In this project, we implemented an end-to-end algorithm, with input as a set of images, and with the output being the panorama of these images.

## Project 3: MatchMove

Matchmove is a technique to insert computer generated imagery (CGI) seamlessly into a video sequence. The idea of matchmove is to extract and estimate camera parameters from the video. In this project, we shot a video and inserted CGI into the video sequence with Blender and After Effect.

Matchmove is a technique of estimating camera parameters from an input video sequence so that computer generated imagery (CGI) could be seamlessly inserted into the sequence. In this project, you will use tools to create visual effects using matchmove.
